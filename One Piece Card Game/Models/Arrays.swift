Despite this, Krieg's fleet was too weak to stand against strong enemies such as Dracula Mihawk, who single-handedly destroyed almost the entire fleet.

It is a typical bazooka that fires cannonballs, however, if equipped with a Gas Shell, it can fire a huge burst of blue-white flames caused by a combination of fire and gas ejected from the Gas Shell.

Dr. Hogback enhanced Absalom's body with animal parts such as elephant skin, lion jaws, bear and gorilla muscles. This has given him superhuman strength, notable for the fact that he constantly carries two bazookas on his hands, while not showing any signs of fatigue or anything like that. He easily held Nami and lifted her into the air with one hand without any visible effort, which caused Nami to acknowledge his strength.
