Also, this Jolly Roger can be seen on the sails of the Going Merry and the Thousand Sunny. It seems that Luffy's image of the Jolly Roger for his pirate crew was conceived long before he could realize it. Even at the very beginning of the journey, when Luffy had just recruited the first nakama, Roronoa Zoro, into his team, he imagined how he would look on his own pirate ship, on which he presented his Jolly Roger, which in the end turned out to be so. The realization of the image took place at the beginning of his journey with Usopp, Nami, and Zoro. He presented his version of the pirate flag to everyone, but the nakama criticized him. Usopp then stated that he was a great artist and they should have contacted him immediately, after which he drew a version of Luffy in good condition. After the Straw Hats' meeting with Laboon, Luffy promised him that he would return to see him under the pretext of a rematch. As a sign of his promised rematch, Luffy drew a Jolly Roger on Laboon's wounds, noting that he would only wash him away after he had bypassed the Grand Line and they would meet again.", isPurchased: true, id: 1))
